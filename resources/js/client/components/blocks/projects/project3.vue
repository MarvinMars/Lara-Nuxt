								<h3>Redesign</h3>
								<p>Establishing a partnership with the University of Arkansas we were able to achieve their goal of creating a more dynamic fan experience while users were searching for their team. We understood mobile was going to be extremely important so we designed a responsive website for phones, tablets and computers. Our creative and technical teams collaborated to come up with the endless scroll feature used on their site.</p>
								<p>We understood our target market uses social media platforms frequently so our team wanted to mirror the feel of a social media platform with the endless scroll. While trying to obtain a more interactive site our team integrated a twitter feed on the videos so fans could tweet directly from the video player. This overall design accomplished the University’s goal of getting users more involved.</p>

						<h2>Developing an Online Apparel Marketplace</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="numbers__text col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
								<p>We partnered with Shop.ArkansasRazorbacks.com to manage all of their digital marketing efforts, and when we began with Arkansas, we noticed that their organic traffic from Google search was quite low, and not attracting nearly as many potential customers off the web as such a prestigious program should be getting.</p>
								<small>We knew that fans were searching for licensed Razorbacks apparel through online shopping, ranging from men’s Razorbacks shirts and gameday cups, to adjustable caps. We immediately got to working on their SEO strategy, by creating a specialized responsive web design for a phone or tablet, while going through each and every item in the shop on the backend - handcrafting the most optimal titles, search engine tags, and descriptions for ideal organic search relevance. Building a polished and intuitive mobile shopping site was a priority, as shopping from handheld devices continues to grow every year, and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.</small>
